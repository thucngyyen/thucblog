<p>Due to a plugin called <code>jekyll-titles-from-headings</code> which is supported by GitHub Pages by default. The above header (in the markdown file) will be automatically used as the pages title.</p>

<p>If the file does not start with a header, then the post title will be derived from the filename.</p>

<p>This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.</p>
